This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]

## Important Concepts

1. The ```generateStaticParams``` function can be used in combination with dynamic route segments to statically generate routes at build time instead of on-demand at request time.

2. dynamicParams
Control what happens when a dynamic segment is visited that was not generated with generateStaticParams.

true (default): Dynamic segments not included in generateStaticParams are generated on demand.

false: Dynamic segments not included in generateStaticParams will return a 404.
